## About Rust for RSE

**rs4rse** is an online/offline hybrid initiative to support and connect Research Software Engineers (RSEs) who are interested in or currently using the Rust programming language.

Our goal is to build a friendly and practical community for RSEs to explore how Rust can empower scientific computing, research infrastructure, and reproducible software development. 
Events, discussions, and resources are tailored for RSE workflows, from performance-critical simulations to secure data pipelines.

We host meetups, tutorials, learning clubs and community hangouts designed with the RSE schedule in mind — often short and focused, or aligned with academic/research breaks.

## Code of Conduct

Rust for RSE follows the [Rust Code of Conduct](https://www.rust-lang.org/policies/code-of-conduct), which outlines the expected behavior for all participants and contributors.

Violations of the Code of Conduct can be reported confidentially to the organizers via email at **.

## Disclaimer

Rust for RSE is an independent community project. It is not affiliated with or endorsed by the Rust Project or the Rust Foundation.
