Learning from a real project is fun and inspiring -- it’s the best way to see how Rust's power and safety come together in practice.
In this session, we'll vibe code together on an open-source project from scratch: [vizmat](https://github.com/rs4rse/vizmat)


Along the way, you may learn how to:

- Read and write basic Rust code.
- Use the Bevy game engine to build interactive 3D applications.
- Compile to WASM and run your Rust code anywhere — right in the browser.

Rust is a language empowering everyone to build reliable and efficient software.

Let's meet for open hacking and (co)-learning in our bi-weekly learning group!

Everyone is welcome. Rusties of all skill levels meet and hack on cool Rust stuff.

- Never written a single line of Rust, but interested in the language? There will be people around to get you set up and going.
- Already have a project? Just hack on it or find others interested in contributing. If you have something working, you can put it on the big screen and show everyone.
- Don't have a project yet? There are lots of ideas and cool projects floating around that you can work on!

Here are some ideas if you don't know what to hack on:

- Install Rust [https://www.rust-lang.org/downloads.html](https://www.rust-lang.org/downloads.html "https://www.rust-lang.org/downloads.html") .
- Read the Rust book [https://doc.rust-lang.org/](https://doc.rust-lang.org/ "https://doc.rust-lang.org/")
- Complete Rustlings (a great beginners course!) [https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings "https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings")

Bring your ideas, questions & projects and let's meet.

* What did you work on this week?
* What problems did you solve this week with Rust?
* Are you just learning Rust and want some topic explained?
* Found an interesting crate you want to talk about?

Feel free to join and drop out at any point.
Everyone is invited to join us, no travel necessary.
