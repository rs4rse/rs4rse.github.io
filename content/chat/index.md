## Instructions for the rs4rse chat

To stay connected with the Rust for RSE community, go to our [slack chat](https://bit.ly/rs4rse-slack) and sign up there. We use this space to coordinate the weekly Rustlings practice sessions, discuss ideas for the occasional more formal meetings, and share cool things relating to Rust and/or research software engineering.

You're welcome to join the conversation — whether it's about high-performance computing, safe parallelism, or best practices in research software — especially if Rust is involved!
